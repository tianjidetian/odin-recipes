        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Think of Eggplant Parmigiana as a pasta-less vegetarian Lasagna, made with thin 
            slices of eggplant instead of pasta, layered with tomato sauce, fresh basil and 
            plenty of molten cheese. Called <em>Parmigiana di Melanzane</em> in Italian and 
            known as <em>Eggplant Parmesan</em> in the US, it’s a low-carb dream come true!

            A southern Italian classic, this is one of those incredible vegetarian dishes 
            that’s so good, even card-carrying carnivores won’t pause for a moment to wonder,
             “Where’s the meat??” This is comfort food for everyone. It oozes with <strong>
            cheesy</strong> goodness – molten mozzarella on top and the savoury hum of parmesan 
            within. It’s slick and bright with fresh tomato sauce. It’s dotted with addictive 
            pops of fresh basil leaves like a great margherita pizza. And with every bite,
             you get a mouthful of the <strong>juicy, soft</strong> eggplant layers.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Think of Eggplant Parmigiana as a pasta-less vegetarian Lasagna, made with thin 
            slices of eggplant instead of pasta, layered with tomato sauce, fresh basil and 
            plenty of molten cheese. Called <em>Parmigiana di Melanzane</em> in Italian and 
            known as <em>Eggplant Parmesan</em> in the US, it’s a low-carb dream come true!
        </p>
        <p>
            A southern Italian classic, this is one of those incredible vegetarian dishes 
            that’s so good, even card-carrying carnivores won’t pause for a moment to wonder,
             “Where’s the meat??” This is comfort food for everyone. It oozes with <strong>
            cheesy</strong> goodness – molten mozzarella on top and the savoury hum of parmesan 
            within. It’s slick and bright with fresh tomato sauce. It’s dotted with addictive 
            pops of fresh basil leaves like a great margherita pizza. And with every bite,
             you get a mouthful of the <strong>juicy, soft</strong> eggplant layers.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggplants</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Tomato puree</li>
            <li>Crushed or finely diced tomato</li>
            <li>Oregano</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Parmesan</li>
            <li>Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Fresh basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Slice the eggplant lengthwise into 8mm thick slices. Place on to three 
                lined trays and brush each side of every slice with olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in a 220°C (430°F) oven for 35 to 40 minutes until the eggplant is 
                lightly browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sauté onion and garlic with the oil, then add everything else (tomato passata, 
                crushed tomato, oregano or basil, salt and pepper).
            </li>
            <li>
                Simmer for 30 minutes until it reduces into a fairly thick sauce, as pictured below. 
                You should be able to draw a path along the base of the pot that remains visible 
                for a few seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Smear some tomato sauce on the base of a baking dish. This stops the first layer 
                of eggplant from sliding around.
            </li>
            <li>Top with a layer of eggplant, using 1/3 of the eggplant.</li>
            <li>Spread eggplant with 1/3 of the tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with a little olive oil.</li>
            <li>Scatter with 1/3 of the basil leaves.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with 1/3 of the parmesan.</li>
            <li>
                Repeat layering twice more for a total of three eggplant layers. With the top-most 
                layer, (a) add everything except the basil, which we’ll save it for fresh garnish 
                later; (b) sprinkle over all the mozzarella for our melted cheesy topping!
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 25 minutes in a 180°C (350°F) oven until the mozzarella is bubbly and golden, 
                and the smells wafting out of your oven are knee-bucklingly good!

            <em><strong>Tiramisu</strong> is a timeless no-bake Italian dessert combining 
            espresso-dipped ladyfingers and a creamy lightly sweetened mascarpone cream.
            This recipe is from the late Maida Heatter and is easily the best homemade 
            tiramisu recipe</em>

            For those not familiar, Maida Heatter is an icon, especially in the baking world. 
            Dubbed the <strong>Queen of Cake</strong>, her expansive culinary career included 9 
            cookbooks, recipes for the <em>Times</em>, a restaurant, and three James Beard Awards. 
            Baker and author Dorie Greenspan once said <em>“Whenever someone tells me they want to 
            learn to bake, I tell them to start with Maida Heatter’s books. That’s what I did.”</em> 
            This latest cookbook is a testament to Maida’s legacy. She leaves behind an incalculable 
            amount of inspiration to bakers and cooks all over the world.
